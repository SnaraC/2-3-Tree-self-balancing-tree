# 2-3-Tree

C++ implementation of functionalities (insertion, deletion, search) of 2-3-Tree (self-balancing tree). 

Made by: Sovannara Chou

This is one of my projects in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics II (CSS 343) at UWB. 

Project goal: creating a 2-3tree to build balancing tree working up to 100k input values. PASS TEST!

**Description:**

**- insert**
  Use find function to find the node then use insert function to insert data/value.
  Important: Split function to split the node if tree node is full(3 node) for balancing purpose. 

**- search**
  Search function will return the value that we search for.

**- remove** 
  Use find function to find the node then use remove function to remove data/value.
  Important: Merge function to merge the node if tree node is empty for balancing purpose.
